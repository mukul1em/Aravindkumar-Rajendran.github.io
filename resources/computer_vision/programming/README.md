title: Programming Language
---

Programming is a way to communicate to the computer.

<br/>

**Let's have a small conversation with our computer**

**Human**: Hi Computer, How are you?
  
**Computer**: 000111000111110

**Human**: What are you talking about?

**Computer**: 01000110001000

**Human**: What the heck is that?

**Computer**: 11001000101

<br/>

This is how a conversation looks like if we don't have a programming language. (This is just for illustrative purpose. It actually does not works like that because even computers can not understand our natural language as it is. But we are actively trying to teach the computers to understand our natural language using NLP - think about Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri, Cortana and Bixby).

<br />

**What does a computer know?**

1010100011 - Zeros and Ones

That is called as machine code.

<br />

**What do you mean by programming language?**

Think of programming language is a bridge between machine code and human language. It does not exactly looks like a natural human language but mostly English written according to the syntax.

Syntax is the format of the programming language that a specific compiler or intrepreter accepts.

### **Human &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programming Language &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compiler or Intrepreter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Machine code &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer**

<br />
<br />

**Why most of the programming language syntax are in English?**

Because English is the global business language and importantly most computer scientist who developed were known English.

For your curiosity see this Chinese version of Python language. http://www.chinesepython.org/

Variable names, syntax and whole program can be written in Chinese.
